# Design Principles

Our component library is built on a set of core design principles that guide our development process and ensure a consistent, high-quality user experience.

## Accessibility First

We believe that great design is accessible to everyone. All components are built with accessibility in mind from the start, not as an afterthought.

- **WCAG Compliance**: Components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements are fully keyboard accessible
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML
- **Color Contrast**: Text meets minimum contrast requirements

## Consistency

Consistency creates familiarity and reduces cognitive load for users.

- **Visual Consistency**: Consistent spacing, typography, and color usage
- **Behavioral Consistency**: Interactions work the same way across components
- **API Consistency**: Component props follow consistent patterns

## Flexibility

Components are designed to be flexible enough to meet a wide range of use cases.

- **Composable**: Components can be combined in various ways
- **Customizable**: Variants and props allow for customization
- **Themeable**: Support for different visual themes

## Performance

Performance is a feature, not an afterthought.

- **Bundle Size**: Components are optimized for minimal bundle size
- **Rendering Performance**: Efficient rendering with minimal re-renders
- **Lazy Loading**: Support for code splitting and lazy loading

## Developer Experience

A great component library should be a joy to use for developers.

- **Intuitive APIs**: Props and component names that make sense
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear examples and API documentation
- **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript definitions for all components
- **Predictable Behavior**: Components behave as expected with no surprises

## Design Tokens

Our design system is built on a foundation of design tokens that ensure consistency across the entire library.

### Colors

We use a semantic color system that separates color usage from specific color values:

- **Primary**: Main brand color, used for primary actions
- **Secondary**: Complementary color, used for secondary actions
- **Accent**: Highlight color, used sparingly for emphasis
- **Destructive**: Used for destructive actions
- **Muted**: Used for backgrounds and less prominent elements
- **Foreground**: Text and icon colors

### Typography

Our typography system is based on a limited set of font sizes and weights:

- **Font Family**: Inter (sans-serif)
- **Font Sizes**: From xs (0.75rem) to 5xl (3rem)
- **Font Weights**: Regular (400), Medium (500), Semibold (600), Bold (700)
- **Line Heights**: Appropriate line heights for each font size

### Spacing

We use a consistent spacing scale throughout the library:

- **4-point Grid**: All spacing is based on multiples of 4px
- **Named Tokens**: xs (4px), sm (8px), md (16px), lg (24px), xl (32px), etc.

### Borders & Shadows

Consistent borders and shadows create depth and hierarchy:

- **Border Radius**: From square (0px) to full (9999px)
- **Border Width**: From none (0px) to thick (4px)
- **Shadows**: From subtle to pronounced elevation
